    <h1> About Me </h1>

    <p>
        I am a Computer Science (Bachelor of Science) major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, due to graduate
        this upcoming spring. I've previously been an intern at Google and General Electric. Meanwhile, I am
        currently working at ZocDoc, a NYC-based health scheduling software company. In my previous life, I was
        a professional ballerina.
